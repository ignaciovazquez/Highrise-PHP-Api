Highrise-PHP-Api is a project (currently in alpha) to provide easy access to 37signals' Highrise API to PHP Developers.

Documentation is coming soon, please check the test directory for examples.

This PHP Class currently allows CRUD support for People objects only. Support for other object types will be uploaded shortly.

Please mind the tests are only supposed to run in a blank Highrise account and not on a live one.

Features currently implemented:

* People
* Tasks
* Notes
* Emails
* Tags
* Users
